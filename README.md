## 🏛️ Government, CJIS & Law-Enforcement Experience

I bring deep experience delivering and supporting **mission-critical systems in CJIS-aware, law-enforcement, and justice environments**, where **security failures, downtime, or data integrity issues are not acceptable**.

My work has supported systems used daily by **courts, clerks, detention centers, law enforcement agencies, DMV, and central IT organizations**, operating under strict governance, audit, and operational constraints.

### ⚖️ Justice & Law-Enforcement Systems
- Designed, enhanced, and supported **court case management and ERP-style systems** used across criminal, civil, and administrative operations.
- Delivered integrations supporting the **Odyssey Court Management System**, enabling secure data exchange between courts and external justice partners.
- Enabled **cross-agency information flow** between law enforcement, detention facilities, courts, and state agencies while preserving data accuracy and traceability.
- Supported **batch processing, scheduled jobs, and real-time integrations** critical to daily justice operations.

### 🔐 CJIS-Aware Security & Compliance
- Built systems with **CJIS security principles in mind**, including controlled access, least privilege, auditability, and environment separation.
- Implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)**, authentication, and authorization aligned with county and justice-system security policies.
- Worked within environments requiring **formal change management, approvals, and traceability** before production deployments.
- Designed integrations and workflows with **audit readiness**, logging, and accountability as first-class requirements.

### 🔄 Enterprise Integration & Operational Reliability
- Built and maintained **BizTalk orchestrations, schemas, pipelines, and message-based integrations** supporting high-volume, daily justice data exchange.
- Modernized legacy platforms by migrating **.NET Framework applications to .NET Core**, improving security, performance, and maintainability.
- Monitored system health, integration performance, and batch processing to proactively identify and resolve issues.
- Performed **root-cause analysis, data reconciliation, and incident support** using advanced SQL queries and diagnostic logs.

### 📋 Documentation, Governance & Knowledge Transfer
- Authored **technical documentation, system diagrams, SOPs, and runbooks** to support audits, onboarding, and long-term sustainability.
- Maintained structured documentation in **SharePoint and internal knowledge bases**, reducing operational risk and single-point-of-failure knowledge.
- Collaborated closely with analysts, leadership, vendors, and central IT to translate **policy, compliance, and operational requirements** into technical solutions.

---

## 🔗 Why This Matters to Private-Sector Teams

Experience in CJIS and law-enforcement environments directly translates to **stronger engineering outcomes in any regulated or high-scale organization**.

Teams benefit from engineers who:
- Design systems assuming **failure is costly**, not theoretical
- Prioritize **security, observability, and auditability** from day one
- Respect **change control, production stability, and backward compatibility**
- Write software that is **maintainable by teams—not just its original author**
- Communicate clearly with **non-technical stakeholders** under real operational pressure

In practice, this means I bring:
- Fewer production incidents  
- Safer deployments  
- Better documentation  
- More predictable delivery  
- Systems that scale **operationally**, not just technically  

> **Bottom line:**  
> Building software for justice and law-enforcement environments trains you to engineer for **trust, reliability, and accountability**—qualities that elevate both public-sector and private-sector systems.
